WARNING - blockcheck: PLL 'pll_inst/PLLInst_0' : CLKOS is used in bypass mode.
chipcheck: INFO: Design contains EBR with ASYNC Reset Mode that has a limitation: The use of the EBR block asynchronous reset requires that certain timing be met between the clock and the reset within the memory block. See the device specific datasheet for additional details.
DRC detected 0 errors and 1 warnings.
